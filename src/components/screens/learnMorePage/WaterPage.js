          Water is a basic and necessary resource for human living conditions.
          Throughout the campus, at any given moment, water is being used, even
          if it is obviously above it. In everyday life, it is impossible to
          have an activity without water around the campus, especially in the
          hot summer months. It is extremely important to locate leaks, pipeline
          explosions and unwise use (close to real time). In the first phase we
          will alert the relevant officials and in a more advanced phase of a
          project - we will stop the waste.
